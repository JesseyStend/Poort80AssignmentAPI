# Project for Poort80 as an assignment
This project was created as an assignment for Poort80. It has been made with asp.net + en 6 for the microservice and react.js + MUI core for the frontend. I put a little more then one week time of work into this project. Learned a lot about C# and the frameworks in C#.

## Structure
There are 2 folders in this project, both have a README.md file which describes the start-up of the app and how it is used. The back-end is located at the Poort80Assignment folder and the front-end is located in the frontend folder.
