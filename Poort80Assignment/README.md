# Backend of the project
This is the folder where the microservice is located. This README is just a simple start-up guide.

## Disclamer
I justed visual studio 2022 to create this project. I will do my best at describing the start-up as best as I can if you use a different IDE.

## Connection string
The connection string is configed to my localdb. please update this with a database which works for you. The string is found in ./appsettings.json.

## Packages
All the packages should be pre-installed. If this is not the case, please try searching how the packages are installed

## Migrations
With all the packages installed, you should be able to run the command "Update-database". All the migrations should be installing at this point.

## StartUp
To simply startup the microservice, please press the play button in visual studio or use the dotnet command.
